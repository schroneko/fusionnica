# If you notice a mistake in the text

This Fusionnica is a newborn baby if you compare it to a human being.

Just as any book contains minor mistakes and can unintentionally turn into mistakes over time, you may inevitably overlook typographical errors, inaccurate expressions, or mistakes.

We will do our best to reduce mistakes as much as possible, but we recommend that you read it after recognizing that there are mistakes. If you find any mistakes while reading, please report them.

Also, even trivial questions and even the consequences of misunderstandings should improve mutual understanding through discussions. Please feel free to contact us.
