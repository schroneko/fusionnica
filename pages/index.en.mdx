# Fusionnica

Nuclear fusion technology has attracted attention around the world.

Since nuclear fusion is a state-of-the-art technology that incorporates a wide variety of technologies, it is said that it is very difficult for even those who are specialized in research to grasp the whole picture.

Fusionnica aims to be a fusion technology Britannica that is useful not only for beginners to researchers but also for start-up companies and investors by providing a cross-sectional explanation of fusion technology.

We hope that it will stimulate readers' problems and intellectual curiosity, and eventually contribute to the realization of nuclear fusion.
